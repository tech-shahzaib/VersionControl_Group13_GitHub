1. Introduction:
GitHub is currently the most used web-based platform for hosting Git repositories. While Git is the version control technology itself, essentially tracking changes in the files, GitHub provides the interface and collaboration tools necessary to make Git into such a strong social coding and team management platform. It allows developers and teams to store, track, and manage their code projects in the cloud.
It allows developers to store, manage, and track changes in their code, and collaborate with others on projects, whether small or large.

2. Key Features of GitHub:

3. Purpose of the Collaboration Exercise
For this assignment, our main focus is on Branching and Pull Requests. Each team member will create a branch and contribute a section to this report. The Team Leader should then use Pull Requests to review and merge all those sections, specifically demonstrating the ability to resolve merge conflicts in a realistic scenario.

Conclusuion:
GitHub is a powerful platform for managing software projects using Git. It allows team collaboration, tracking of changes, branching, and merging. Its pull requests and review features make it easy to maintain high-quality code while working with multiple contributors.”
