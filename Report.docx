1. Introduction:
GitHub is presently the most widely utilized web-based platform for hosting Git repositories. While Git serves as the underlying version control system, responsible for tracking changes in files, GitHub provides a comprehensive interface and collaborative tools that transform Git into a robust platform for social coding and team management. 
It enables developers and teams to securely store, monitor, and manage their code projects in cloud.

2. Key Features of GitHub:

Version Control: Manages and tracks all modifications made to the codebase over time using Git, ensuring efficient collaboration and rollback options when needed.

Repositories: Serve as centralized storage locations containing all project files, along with their complete version history and documentation.

Branches: Allow developers to work on new features, fixes, or experiments independently without affecting the main codebase.

Pull Requests: Facilitate collaboration by enabling contributors to propose changes, discuss improvements, and request reviews before merging updates into the main branch.

Commits: Represent saved versions or snapshots of the project, each accompanied by descriptive messages explaining the specific changes made.

Issues: Provide an organized way to report bugs, suggest enhancements, and manage project-related tasks, improving workflow transparency and communication.

3. Purpose of the Collaboration Exercise
For this assignment, our main focus is on Branching and Pull Requests. Each team member will create a branch and contribute a section to this report. The Team Leader should then use Pull Requests to review and merge all those sections, specifically demonstrating the ability to resolve merge conflicts in a realistic scenario.
