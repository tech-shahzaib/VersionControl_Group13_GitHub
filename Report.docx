1. Introduction:
GitHub is presently the most widely utilized web-based platform for hosting Git repositories. While Git serves as the underlying version control system, responsible for tracking changes in files, GitHub provides a comprehensive interface and collaborative tools that transform Git into a robust platform for social coding and team management. 
It enables developers and teams to securely store, monitor, and manage their code projects in cloud.

2. Key Features of GitHub:

Version Control: Manages and tracks all modifications made to the codebase over time using Git, ensuring efficient collaboration and rollback options when needed.

Repositories: Serve as centralized storage locations containing all project files, along with their complete version history and documentation.

Branches: Allow developers to work on new features, fixes, or experiments independently without affecting the main codebase.

Pull Requests: Facilitate collaboration by enabling contributors to propose changes, discuss improvements, and request reviews before merging updates into the main branch.

Commits: Represent saved versions or snapshots of the project, each accompanied by descriptive messages explaining the specific changes made.

Issues: Provide an organized way to report bugs, suggest enhancements, and manage project-related tasks, improving workflow transparency and communication.

3. Conclusion:
This exercise emphasizes the use of Branching and Pull Requests to enhance collaborative development. Each team member contributes through individual branches, while the Team Leader manages reviews and merges, showcasing practical skills in handling merge conflicts and teamwork within GitHub.
